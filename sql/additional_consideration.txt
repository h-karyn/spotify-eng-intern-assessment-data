The queries and tests were constructed based on the requirements in the sql files. All the data from the csv files are loaded
into the database by a call from test_sql_queries.py.

However, three tables, namely, Reviews, Order_items and Cart_items are not fully loaded, due to the foreign key constraints.
Data entries in those three tables are dependent on the data in other tables. For example, the Order_items table has a foreign
key constraint on the product_id column, which is a primary key in the Products table. Although product_id of 17 exists in order_items_data.csv,
product_id of 17 does not exist in the Products table. Therefore, the data entry for product_id of 17 in order_items_data.csv cannot be loaded.

This could be a common challenge in the real world when digitalizing and creating a database for a business: the historical
data may not be complete or accurate. In such cases, the data engineer needs to work with the business to decide how to handle
the missing data. For example, the data engineer could decide to drop the data entries with missing foreign keys, or to drop the
foreign key constraints in the database to ensure data integrity.
